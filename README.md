# Muscling

Our application helps cross-fit enthusiasts plan and comment on their fitness routines by obtaining workouts from their favorite gym and is deployed via Heroku.

One of our teammates is a cross-fit member and another has a family member who attends cross-fit.  We thought our application would help people plan their workouts and keep track of the workouts they have completed.  In addition, they can share their daily scores and compare their results to others.
